# git-visualize
Visualize the results of Git operations within the terminal without side effects to the current repository.

The goal of git-visualize is to provide a fast-built-into-terminal tool allowing the display of operations results for Git beginner or an experienced user who wants to utilize a terminal for Git experience.

This repository is inspired by :star:[git-sim](https://github.com/initialcommit-com/git-sim), a visualization library (worth checking out) written in Python capable of generating graphical representations along with videos that simulate Git operations. The main difference (besides the language used to write the tool) is the aim of git-visualize to work exclusively within the terminal (no external resource creation like images or videos) and minimal dependencies required to work (it shall be a single executable).
